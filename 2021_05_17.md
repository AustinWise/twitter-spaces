# Twitter Space on May 17th, 2021

We've been holding a Twitter Space weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour. In addition to [Bryan Cantrill](https://twitter.com/bcantrill) and [Adam Leventhal](https://twitter.com/ahl), speakers included [Adam Jacob](https://twitter.com/adamhjk/), [Matt Ranney](https://twitter.com/mranney), [Nima Johari](https://twitter.com/NimaJohari), [Antranig Vartanian](https://twitter.com/antranigv), [Joshua Clulow](https://twitter.com/jmclulow), [Tom Lyon](https://twitter.com/aka_pugs), and [Bob Mader](https://twitter.com/c50bae86ae1b461) (and thanks to [Jeremy Morris](https://twitter.com/morrislaw93?lang=en) for [catching Bob's profile!](https://twitter.com/MorrisLaw93/status/1394497085592981510)).

(Did we miss your name and/or get it wrong? Leave a comment and we'll fix it!)

We recorded the space, but we had some challenges, and we lost the recording when the first Twitter Space died at around 5:30p. We recorded the second half though; [the recording is here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tJEwCvZWsg).
