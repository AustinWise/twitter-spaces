# Twitter Space on June 7, 2021

We've been holding a Twitter Space weekly on Mondays at 5p (PT) for about an hour. In addition to [Bryan Cantrill](https://twitter.com/bcantrill) and [Adam Leventhal](https://twitter.com/ahl), speakers included XXX.

(Did we miss your name and/or get it wrong? Drop a PR!)

Some of the topics we hit on, in order that we hit them:

- [The Seagate ST3000DM001](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ST3000DM001)
- [The Seagate Barracuda product line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seagate_Barracuda)
- PRs needed!

Our next Twitter space will be on Monday at 5p Pacific Time. Join us; we always love to hear from new speakers!
