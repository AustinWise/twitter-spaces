# Twitter Space on June 21, 2021

We've been holding a Twitter Space weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour. In addition to [Bryan Cantrill](https://twitter.com/bcantrill) and [Adam Leventhal](https://twitter.com/ahl), speakers included XXX.

Some of the topics we hit on, in order that we hit them:
